<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>The Tri-City Band Corps was founded in 2004 as a spinoff of another local community band which was founded 1 year prior. It was in July of 2004 when the two groups decided to split based off management ideology. The Tri-City Band Corps wanted to put learning and students first, envisioning an organization led and run completely by high school students. These students would be responsible for all aspects of the group including legal, music, membership, logistics, finance, and more. The group first met on July 4th, 2004, and officially organized itself on July 11th, 2004 under the leadership of Harrison Cheng and TBC’s first CEO Eric Ching. The group was founded on a few major ideals, which remain essential to the operation of the group today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Honor – Harrison made a promise to the friends he had recruited that this would be an organization which would provide them musical, leadership, and educational opportunities. When he felt that the previous community band they had been in could no longer live up to those commitments, Harrison spent a great deal of his personal finances and countless hours to get TBC started, despite never formally serving as an officer of TBC, since he wanted to provide leadership roles for other students. To this day, TBC has never made a commitment to its members or partner organizations that it has not kept, even when at times, the cost outweighed the benefits.</li>
<li>Loyalty – TBC values the friendships and bonds forged within the group and places great weight on the contributions each members makes to the group as a whole. A large factor in our officer selection process includes the dedication each member has shown to the group. In turn, TBC makes sure that the group remains a safe, open, and supportive environment for all members.
<li>Education – The group was founded to provide students a chance to learn and practice leadership skills, musical skills, and to mutually support each other.</li>
Without any funding, Harrison, as a recent high school graduate, spent $6,000 of his own money to get the group started by purchasing instruments, music, and uniforms. During this time, Harrison and Eric would also make pitches for support to local volunteer organizations, the group found its first major supporter through Citizens for a Better Community (CBC) a few months later, which to this day remains a strong supporter of TBC with regular donations, partnerships, and support for rehearsal facilities. </li>
</ol>
<p>Three years later in 2007, the last 2 students, who were both Freshmen when Harrison had recruited them into the East Bay Scout Band, graduated from Mission High School. Despite having fulfilled his initial goal, with the continued growth and success of TBC, Harrison decided to keep the group running.</p>
<p>Today, TBC boasts a membership of over 250 students who have participated with us one way or another in the last year. In 2014, TBC also set a record for having over 120 members at a single performance, the first the time group has broken 100 members. Over the years TBC has included members from: Mission, Irvington, Kennedy, American, Washington, Logan, Piedmont, and California High Schools. TBC is the largest and only marching band program available outside of the school system focused on community parades, and is the only program run completely by high school students.</p>
<p>We participate in several parades throughout the year, such as 1) the Festival of Lights Parade in Niles, 2) the Hollister Lights On Parade, 3) the Festival of Globe Parade, 4) the Fremont July 4th Parade, and 5) the Salinas Colmo Rodeo Parade. In addition, for the 2015-2016 season, TBC attended the annual London New Year’s Day Parade.</p>
<p>While the officer boards and students have changed year after year, much remains the same as well. Each student member and especially the officers learn a great deal, not just in the theories of leadership, but through hands on practical training as well. Many of our senior leaders have gone on to great institutions and future careers having learned from their time with TBC.</p>
